# Dissemination Project Website

A static, professional website for a technology-focused dissemination project.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Home
- `project.html` – The Project (details, diagrams, images)
- `consortium.html` – Consortium (partners, team)
- `deliverables.html` – Deliverables (downloads)
- `contact.html` – Contact form and details
- `assets/css/styles.css` – Global theme
- `assets/js/main.js` – Basic interactivity
- `assets/img/` – Place images here
- `downloads/` – Place public PDFs/ZIPs here

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview locally.
2. Replace placeholders in `assets/img/` with real images, and update page content.
3. Put PDFs/ZIPs into `downloads/` and update links in `deliverables.html`.
4. Update contact info in `contact.html`.

## Deployment

You can host this as static files on any provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.).

- For Netlify: drag-and-drop the `dissemination-site/` folder into Netlify.
- For GitHub Pages: push to a repo and enable Pages for the `main` branch `/root`.

## Customization

- Adjust brand name and logo in the header across pages.
- Modify the theme colors in `:root` within `assets/css/styles.css`.
- Add more deliverables by replicating an item block in `deliverables.html`.
